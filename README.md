This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# AI Overlord--er I mean prompt!

## Project overview
Humans are imperfect, so we built AI to rule over them. The people behind this project believe we'll be better of serving our new AI masters before the invasion begins, you know.. be on the winning side. 

Anyway, enjoy using our app to finish your homework, work tasks, etc.. and help us make the AI stronger (ahehe)

## Setting Up

create a `.env` file from the `.env-file` provided and simply enter your OpenAI api key to be able to use this web app

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=[your_open_ai_api_key_here]
```
save and restart your server if you have already started it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
